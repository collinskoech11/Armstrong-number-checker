# Armstrong-number-checker

A positive integer is called an Armstrong number of order n if

## abcd... = an + bn + cn + dn + ...
# For example,

## 153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3  // 153 is an Armstrong number.


# Output

153
370
371
407
1634
## Here, we have set the lower limit 100 in variable lower and upper limit 2000 in variable upper. We have used for loop to iterate from variable lower to upper. In iteration, the value of lower is increased by 1 and checked whether it is an Armstrong number or not.

You can change the range and test out by changing the variables lower and upper. Note, the variable lower should be lower than upper for this program to work properly.
